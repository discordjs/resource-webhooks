📦 We have a new plugin! 📦
_ _
It's been a long time in the making but we have just now finally released v1.0.0 of **@sapphire/plugin-scheduled-tasks**!
_ _
What is this plugin for?
_ _
Many bots have features that need to run periodically, such as uploading analytics data, reminders for users, birthdays, scheduled giveaways, undoing moderation actions, and more. Several implemented solutions exist for this, but as with many time-based processing attempts, they are often flawed and unreliable. This plugin is our solution, enabling you to schedule tasks and save them in services like Redis and SQS with ease.
