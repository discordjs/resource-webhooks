**• About help channels:**
> This server is for discord.js support only. If your question is not about interacting with discord.js, you are in the wrong place. We do not provide support for other people's packages, frameworks, libraries, or guides. You can find invites to general programming servers in %USEFUL_SERVERS_CHANNEL%.
> 
> Everyone assisting you is a volunteer and takes time out of their day to help you with your problem. Please show them courtesy and try to solve your problems yourself before coming here. Check out %HOW_TO_ASK_CHANNEL% if you are unsure how to ask a good question.
_ _
**• Required knowledge:**
> We expect a __solid__ understanding of JavaScript, so you understand the answers you get. Should you struggle with that, please brush up on base JavaScript and Node.js concepts. You can find additional resources in %RESOURCES_CHANNEL%.
> 
> We also expect you to know your development environment (editor, command line, hardware, etc.). We will also not assist you with hosting your bot on any platform.

_ _
**• Version 11:**
> Discord.js has moved on to version 12. We will no longer maintain or provide support for version 11. Please update at your earliest convenience.
_ _
**• Excluded topics:**
> We will not assist you with malicious intents like spamming users or the API, exploiting, scamming, trolling, mass-banning, invading people's privacy, or others not explicitly listed here. Posting this kind of question can result in restrictions or removal at the staff's discretion.

**• Helping others:**
> - We appreciate it if you want to help!
> - If someone asks a question, please do not throw the code they are looking for at them but, instead, provide them with the tools they need to write it themselves.
> - Be polite! We know it can be frustrating if questions repeat over and over. If it gets too much, take a break!
> - If you are unsure: do some research! Everyone can be wrong, but if it becomes excessive, we will remove you from the channel.
> - If you spot a situation that requires intervention, please contact moderators! Excessive mini-modding is not appreciated.
