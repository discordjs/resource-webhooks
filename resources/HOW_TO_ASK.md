**• Before asking:**
> **Try to find the answer yourself.**
> The answer to your issue is often a typo or can be found by carefully reading the documentation or error you receive. Solving problems takes time. Trying to get others to invest this time instead of yourself is not a nice thing to do. Their time is just as valuable as yours is.

**• Debug your code**
> We do not have immediate access to your code. Please do some debugging on your own before asking your question here.
> 
> - catch promise rejections
> - read your errors carefully
> - error messages do not always point at the exact line the error is. Look around your code!
> ```
> C:\Users\me\mybot\index.js:8
> SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
> ```
> There is a syntax error in `index.js` line `8` and has something to do with an unexpected token. This error could be caused by not closing or opening another bracket in another part of that file!

**• Asking the question**
> - provide all information needed (your code, errors you receive, steps you took to debug, things you do that cause the issue (circumstances, commands used, pictures of the output where applicable)).
> - do not paraphrase errors but provide them as is and with a full stack trace (the stack trace shows where the error originates).
> - prepare your question, make sure it's comprehensible, and don't write every thought down. Messages like "hmm", "ooooh", "I'm so dumb", "HELP!!!", or similar clutter the channel.

** • After asking**
> - If your question is still unanswered even after days, that is unfortunate! But please don't spam it. Try to re-phrase it slightly, provide more information, be more verbose in what you expect as an answer.
> - If you did not understand a given answer, be specific about what exactly it is you did not understand. "What?!", "Huh", "That didn't help", "Don't just send docs", "I don't understand" do not help to improve the answer, so you understand it.
> - Don't delete your question! Someone else might find it through the search function and benefit from it!
