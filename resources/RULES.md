**Please read each of these rules thoroughly.**
They're for everybody's benefit, and help foster a healthy community.
_ _
**1.** No spamming, advertising, or NSFW content. Don't be a jerk or generally obnoxious - nobody likes trolls.
_ _
**2.** We expect you to have a solid understanding of JavaScript. Do not ask general questions here. There is a countless number of exceptional online resources at your disposal. All you have to do is look for them. We can usually point you in the right direction, but don't expect us to teach you the fundamentals from scratch.
_ _
**3.** This server is for discord.js. We are not able to assist you with unrelated libraries.
_ _
**4.** When asking for help, make sure to provide as much detail as possible. Simply saying, "it's broke yo", or "how 2 make music bot" certainly won't get either of us anywhere.
_ _
**5.** Don't expect us to hold your hand entirely. We can help you understand concepts and locate the correct resources, but not write your code for you.
_ _
**6.** Do not mention or DM individual members just for help. You may not get a reply quickly, if at all. Post your question in the public channels where more people can see it.
_ _
**7.** If your username can't be easily mentioned, please set your nickname to something mentionable. For example, "ᐃᑦᑎᓂᖅᓯᐅᑐᖅ ᑕᖅᓴᖅ" isn't particularly useful.
