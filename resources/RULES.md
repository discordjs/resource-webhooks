**Please read each of these rules thoroughly.**
They're for everybody's benefit, and help foster a healthy community.

_ _
**1.** No spamming, advertising, or NSFW content. Don't be a jerk or generally obnoxious - nobody likes trolls.

_ _
**2.** We expect you to have a solid understanding of JavaScript. Do not ask general questions here. There is a countless number of exceptional online resources at your disposal, some of which we have provided for you in %RESOURCES_CHANNEL%. We can usually point you in the right direction, but don't expect us to teach you the fundamentals from scratch.

_ _
**3.** This server is for discord.js. We are not able to assist you with unrelated libraries.

_ _
**4.** When asking for help, make sure to provide as much detail as possible. Simply saying, "it's broke yo", or "how 2 make music bot" certainly won't get either of us anywhere.

_ _
**5.** Don't expect us to hold your hand entirely. We can help you understand concepts and locate the correct resources, but not write your code for you.

_ _
**6.** Do not mention or DM individual members just for help. You may not get a reply quickly, if at all. Post your question in the public channels where more people can see it.

_ _
**7.** If your username can't be easily mentioned, please set your nickname to something mentionable. For example, "ᐃᑦᑎᓂᖅᓯᐅᑐᖅ ᑕᖅᓴᖅ" isn't particularly useful.

_ _
**8.** No political / controversial content on this server. If you wish to discuss those head over to: https://discord.gg/q4KdJFP
