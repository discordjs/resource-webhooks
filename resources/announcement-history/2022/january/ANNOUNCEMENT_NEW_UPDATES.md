â«¸ Added `PaginatedMessageEmbedFields` class.

**[@sapphire/plugin-hmr v1.1.0](https://github.com/sapphiredev/plugins/compare/@sapphire/plugin-hmr@1.0.1...@sapphire/plugin-hmr@1.1.0) has been released**
_**Features**_
â«¸ Made it possible to set Chokidar options through `clientOptions.hmr`.
â«¸ Previously enabling the plugin only for development required importing `start` from the module and calling that. As we now read client options in `/register` you can also configure it directly in `clientOptions.hmr.enabled`. For example set it to `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` then call `/register` and HMR will only be enabled in development.
