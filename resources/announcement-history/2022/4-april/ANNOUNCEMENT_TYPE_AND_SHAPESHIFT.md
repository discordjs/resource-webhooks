**[@sapphire/type@2.2.4](https://github.com/sapphiredev/type/compare/v2.2.0...@sapphire/type@2.2.4) has been released**
_**Bug Fixes**_
⫸ Configure prebuilds for Node 17 and Node 18 ([ec2e873](https://github.com/sapphiredev/type/commit/ec2e8733446e3fbb2af7231fb26a467be7f6591b)).
⫸ `2.2.1`, `2.2.2` and `2.2.3` are the same. The former 2 had had failing release CI artifacts, and the latter 1 had an incorrect tag format thus breaking prebuilds. For this reason newer patches were required. Apologies for the inconvenience.
