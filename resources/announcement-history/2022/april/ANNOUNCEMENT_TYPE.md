# [@sapphire/type@2.2.3](https://github.com/sapphiredev/type/compare/v2.2.0...@sapphire/type@2.2.3) - (2022-04-26)
_**Bug Fixes**_
⫸ Configure prebuilts for Node 17 and Node 18 ([ec2e873](https://github.com/sapphiredev/type/commit/ec2e8733446e3fbb2af7231fb26a467be7f6591b)).
⫸ `2.2.1` and `2.2.2` are the same, but they had failing release CI artifacts so newer patches were required.
