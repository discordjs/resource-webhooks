**[@sapphire/discord.js-utilities v4.6.0](https://github.com/sapphiredev/utilities/compare/@sapphire/discord.js-utilities@4.5.0...@sapphire/discord.js-utilities@4.6.0) has been released**
_**Bug Fixes**_
⫸ Fixed `PaginatedMessage` not filtering to the correct response and user, causing very weird behaviour when 2 people used a command with `PaginatedMessage` in the same channel.
_ _
⫸ Adjusted the default `wrongUserInteractionReply` message for `PaginatedMessage` to account for the fact that there is also a Select Menu on the `PaginatedMessage` by default. The message has been changed from `Please stop clicking the buttons on this message.` to `Please stop interacting with the components on this message.`
_ _
⫸ Adjusted error message thrown when no actions are provided to the `PaginatedMessage` from `There are no messages.` to `There are no actions.`
_**Features**_
⫸ Added new type guards: `isVoiceBasedChannel` and `isMessageInstance`
　⪢ `isVoiceBasedChannel` takes a channel and is truthy if that channel is a voice based channel.
　⪢ `isMessageInstance` takes a message and is truthy if that message is a message instance, and not an `APIMessage`
_ _
⫸ Added a new utility function: `canJoinVoiceChannel`
　⪢ `canJoinVoiceChannel` takes a channel and returns true if that channel is a voice based channel and the bot can join that channel.

  "allowUnusedLabels": false,
  "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": false,
  "noImplicitOverride": true
}
```

The example usage for `extra-strict` is:
```json
{
  "extends": "@sapphire/ts-config/extra-strict"
}
```
