We have released v2.0.0 of **@sapphire/shapeshift**! Yes v2.0.0, we're not joking. v1 was accidentally published and never officially announced.

What is this package for?

Shapeshift offers blazing fast input validation and transformation, with an API similar to that of [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod). It can also be used in all environments as we offer CJS, ESM and UMD bundles.
