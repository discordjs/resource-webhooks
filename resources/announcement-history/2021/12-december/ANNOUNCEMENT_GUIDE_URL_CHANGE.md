Docusaurus has recently pushed a change that forces us to change the URL for the "getting started" page on the guide. As this was the page you'd land on when pressing the "Guide" button in the top navbar and so some of you may have bookmarked this page we're sending out this announcement to inform you all to update your bookmarks.
