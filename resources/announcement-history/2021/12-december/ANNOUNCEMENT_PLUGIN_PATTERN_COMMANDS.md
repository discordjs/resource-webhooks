ðŸ“¦ We have yet another new plugin! ðŸ“¦
_ _
We have released v1.0.0 of **@sapphire/plugin-pattern-commands**!
_ _
What is this plugin for?
_ _
With pattern commands you can define rules to which the bot may respond. For example if you want there to be an 85% chance that your bot to respond to messages that start with, or include, `postman` it can be as simple as this:
```typescript
import type { Message } from 'discord.js';
import { PatternCommand } from '@sapphire/plugin-pattern-commands';
â€‹
export class WoofCommand extends PatternCommand {
	public constructor(context: PatternCommand.Context, options: PatternCommand.Options) {
		super(context, {
			...options,
			name: 'postman',
			chance: 85
		});
	}
â€‹
	public messageRun(message: Message) {
		message.reply('Woof!');
	}
}
```
(*Warning, there are zero width spaces above `messageRun` and `export class...` for formatting in this announcement*)

ã€€âª¢ `ScheduledTaskEvents.ScheduledTaskRun` / `scheduledTaskRun` - Emitted just before the scheduled task is ran.
ã€€âª¢ `ScheduledTaskEvents.ScheduledTaskSuccess` / `scheduledTaskSuccess` - Emitted when the scheduled task ends successfully.
ã€€âª¢ `ScheduledTaskEvents.ScheduledTaskError` / `scheduledTaskError` - Emitted when the scheduled task throws an error.
ã€€âª¢ `ScheduledTaskEvents.ScheduledTaskFinished` / `scheduledTaskFinished` - Emitted when the scheduled task is finished.
