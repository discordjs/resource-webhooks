## How to Give Help
- Do not use AI to make up an answer for you. Just don't.
- You don't need to respond to everything. Don't make answers up if you are not sure (or at least specify that you are guessing)
- Prefer providing resources and explanations over feeding people solutions.
- Don't respond with "idk", "skill issue", "oof" or other nonsense.
- Remember: Everyone is a beginner at some point in time! Guide people, don't put them down.
 - We do expect a solid understanding of fundamentals, yes. Pointing people into the right direction still does not hurt.
## How to Improve your help
- Imagine you are the one asking the question. Respond in a way that you would find helpful!
- Try to stay calm. If you need a break from the channel, take it, even if people mention you.
- Use the commands in the server to your advantage:
 - Check out the %TAG_COMMAND% command with snippets for common questions!
 - There are also a host of other slash- and right-click application commands on the server that can be useful!
 - You can use the `hide:` option with most commands, if you want to look at the resource before posting it publicly.
## Considerations
- We know helping can be stressful, especially in quickly moving environments!
- If you need a break, take it!
- It's always better to not answer than to blow up on people
- Call mods, if you think the situation is escalating. *(You can use right-click > Apps > Report on messages, if you want to do that silently)*
