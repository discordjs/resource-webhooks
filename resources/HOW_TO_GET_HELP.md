## How to Get Help
- Before asking: Try to find the solution yourself. *(`CTRL` + `F` in this server can answer a lot of questions)*
- Skip "I need help", "Help please", "Can I ask a thing", "I have an error" - Yes you can! Getting help is what this server is for!
- Not a discord.js question? Post in %OTHER_JS_FORUM_CHANNEL% . *(using code in a bot does not mean it is a question about using discord.js!)*
- Consider using %HELP_FORUM_CHANNEL% for questions you think won't be quick to solve.
- You can use %HELP_V13_CHANNEL% or %HELP_V14_CHANNEL% for questions you expect can be quickly solved.
- For voice (sending/receiving sound), please use %HELP_VOICE_FORUM_CHANNEL%.
## How to Ask a (Good) Question
- Show your code.
- Show your errors.
- Explain what happens and what you want to happen instead.
- Text is usually better than screenshots. Use code blocks starting with \`\`\`js or \`\`\`ts. 
## Help Us to Help You
- **Run your code** before asking if it can work. *(errors are often very useful in pin-pointing the issue! )*
- Imagine you are the one trying to help. Ask the question in a way that you would want to read!
- **Post your full error** and relevant code. *(catch promise rejections, provide the context you are working in)*
- If you use custom functions in your snippet, show them to us! *(we only know how the library works, not what the rest of your code looks like)*
- Actively **participate** in the "solution-finding" process. *(don't expect people to fix the code for you)*
- **Explain** what you tried to do to fix the problem.
- **Read** the responses you are given.
- **Research** key words you do not understand before asking what they mean. *(come back and ask, if you cannot find them)*
## No Answer?
- Do not mention uninvolved people to get a response.
- Consider posting in %HELP_FORUM_CHANNEL% .
- Try to rephrase your question.
- Try to give more context / improve your description.
- Try to find a solution yourself while waiting.
