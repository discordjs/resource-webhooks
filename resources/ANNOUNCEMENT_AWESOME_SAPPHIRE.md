**Many of you have been waiting for it and we've been promising it for a good long while and it is finally here!**

We have created the repository [**awesome-sapphire**](https://github.com/sapphiredev/awesome-sapphire). This is a manually curated collection of resources, plugins, utilities, and other assortments for the Sapphire Community projects and follows the standards of the [**Awesome List**](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) template.

It is looking pretty barren now, so we're waiting for you guys to contribute! When doing so, make sure to follow [the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/sapphiredev/awesome-sapphire/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
