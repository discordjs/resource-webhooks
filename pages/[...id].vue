					Greetings, My name is Jeroen Claassens (a.k.a. <span title="My online alias!">Favna</span>) and I manage
					<text-link href="https://github.com/favware" text="Favware" />
				</p>
				<p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
					Currently {{ age }} years old I am a developer hailing from The Netherlands. I have been a tech enthusiast for as long as I can
					remember. While attending high school my first choice of optional subjects was Informatics and this quickly showed to be my
					calling. After I graduated from high school I had no seconds thoughts about my next step - Software Engineering at a university.
					The university of choice ended up being The Hague University of Applied Sciences. After 5 years attending this university I
					obtained my Bachelor of IT in the summer of 2019. At the time of writing I am working for
					<text-link href="https://www.cgi.com/nl/nl" text="CGI inc." />
					in The Netherlands as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. This includes frontend, backend and DevOps work.
				</p>
				<p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
					In my free time I have delved into a whole slew of small to large projects and some of these are used very actively! Notable
					mentions are my work on the
					<text-link href="https://sapphirejs.dev" text="Sapphire Discord bot framework and JavaScript utilities" />, the
					<text-link href="https://github.com/favware/dragonite" text="Dragonite Discord bot" /> and my
					<text-link href="https://redirect.favware.tech/graphqlpokemon" text="PokÃ©mon API" />. For my other work I implore you to check out
					<text-link href="https://redirect.favware.tech/github" text="my GitHub profile" />.

				<p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">
					Outside of programming I enjoy playing video games, primarily action/adventure. I have a lot of love for Ubisoft's Assassin's
					Creed series. I also love consuming audiobooks and my favourite author is Brandon Sanderson. I absolutely adore his Cosmere
					universe. I also enjoy reading the Harry Potter franchise and I tend to re-listen to the series every few years. Overall I have a
					huge weak spot for most anything fantasy. From time to time I also play Dungeons & Dragons with my friends where I use my love for
					fantasy to go on epic table top adventures.
